Duration Formatter
Given an integer number of seconds, return a string representing the same duration in the format "H:MM:SS", 
where "H" is the number of hours, "MM" is the number of minutes, and "SS" is the number of seconds. Return the time using the following rules:

Seconds: Should always be two digits.
Minutes: Should omit leading zeros when they aren't needed. Use "0" if the duration is less than one minute.
Hours: Should be included only if they're greater than zero.
